            Hi, I'm John Doe, a passionate web developer and cycling enthusiast
            based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I've been living in this beautiful
            city for the past 5 years, where I've had the opportunity to immerse
            myself in its vibrant culture and explore its scenic cycling routes.
          </p>
          <p class="intro__text">
            Coding isn't just my profession; it's my passion. I love creating
            innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible
            in web development. When I'm not in front of the computer, you can
            often find me out on the trails, enjoying the breathtaking views and
            exhilarating experiences that cycling has to offer.

            nothing like a good bowl of Thai curry to spice up my day!

            Chiang Mai is a vibrant city located in mountainous northern
            Thailand. It has become a popular destination for digital nomads and
            developers due to its affordable cost of living, reliable internet
            connectivity, and thriving tech community. Many co-working spaces
            and cafes offer ideal environments for remote work.
          </p>

            In addition to its appeal to developers, Chiang Mai is also a haven
            for cyclists. The city and its surrounding countryside offer scenic
            routes and challenging trails for cyclists of all levels. Whether
